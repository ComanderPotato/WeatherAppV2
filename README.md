## Tech/Framework:

* SwiftUI
* WeatherApi: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/
* CoreLocation: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation



## Getting Started

1) Download and Launch: Download the WeatherApp and open it on your device.

2) Location Permission (Optional): The app may request access to your current location. Granting permission allows you to see the weather for your current area automatically.

3) Main Dashboard: Upon launch, you'll be directed to the main weather dashboard. If you granted location permission, the weather for your current location will be displayed prominently at the top of the list, titled 'My Location'.



## Searching for Locations

The weather dashboard features a search bar at the top to easily find weather information for other locations:

1) Enter Location: Type the desired location (city, zip code, etc.) into the search bar.

2) Select Location: Choose the specific location you want to view from the search suggestions.

3) Detailed Forecast: You'll be directed to a detailed weather forecast for the selected location.



## Accessing Detailed Forecasts

There are two ways to access detailed weather forecasts within WeatherApp:

1) Main Dashboard: Simply click on any location displayed on the main dashboard. This will take you to a dedicated view with detailed forecast information for that specific location.

2) Search Functionality: Utilise the search bar on the dashboard to find a specific location (see "Searching for Locations"). Selecting a location from the search results will also display its detailed forecast.


## Saving Favorite Locations

WeatherApp allows you to save frequently viewed locations for quick and easy access:

1) Add Location: While viewing the detailed forecast for a desired location, tap the "Add" button located in the top left corner.

2) Main Dashboard: Navigate back to the main dashboard (usually by tapping a back button in the top left corner).

3) View Saved Location: The saved location will now be listed on the main dashboard. Simply tap the location to access its detailed forecast again.

Note: WeatherApp has a limit of 10 saved locations (including your current location) displayed on the main dashboard.
